<p>
    Hi, I am a third year Electrical Engineering student studying at the University of Waterloo. I expect to graduate by April 2018. I have done internships at several different companies such as LinkedIn and Altera (now a subsidiary of Intel). I am interested in many different fields of technology, engineering, and science. I am always eager to learn technologies (both old and new) or expand my knowledge of the world. I also enjoy playing computer and console games, exercise, movies, and TV shows.

    I am currently looking for a four month winter internship starting January 2017. Feel free to take a look at my <a href="{{ site.url }}/res/resume_kj.pdf">resume</a>.
